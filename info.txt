The project offers us cost-effective flight options.

We can maintain a record of our preferred travel destinations and the cheapest flight prices in a Google Spreadsheet.

The code searches for budget-friendly flight rates in the coming next 6 months and
sends an SMS notification if it finds a rate lower than what's listed in the Google Spreadsheet.

Initially, the code populates the IATA codes for each city and then proceeds to check flight prices.

When it finds rate lower than what's listed in the Google Spreadsheet, then it sends an SMS alert.
